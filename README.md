## Functionalities and Technologies Used

`Stack` : MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

`Technologies Used` : NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express-Validator, BcryptJS, JSONWebToken (JWT), Config etc.

`Functionalities` : REST Api, CRUD, User Registration, Log In, Authentication, JWT Token, PRIVATE and PUBLIC Routes, Create, Read, Update Delete contacts based on Users, Unique Contacts based on Email & Phone per User.

`NOTE`: Contacts are stored in a way that two different users can save contact which has same Email and/or Phone Number. But, Same user cannot have multiple contacts with same Email/Phone. The Email and/or Phone Number is unique for individual user's own contacts.

## From the Developer:

This is a Self Project, made on MERN Stack. After going through basics of MERN I needed some kind of full project to work on and gather some experience on Full Stack MERN Development on my own. So I decided to make a Contact App.

This is a Web App just like Google Contacts, where users can Sign Up, and Create and Store their contacts.

This is the Backend of the whole project. I might upload the Frontend later.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to leave the suggestions. Constructive Criticism is always appreciated.

NOTE: This is a demo project. There can be a lot of more features and functionalities that could be added with this.
